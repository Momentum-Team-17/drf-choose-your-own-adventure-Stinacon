- Will need:
 --> models (created Book; User, Author)
 --> views (class-based views)
 --> urls (in the path, view_name.as_view()?)
 --> serializers

- Views return JSON responses

- QUESTION, re: Serlializers:
 --> In the Book serializer, or any serializer, do I include all of the attributes in "fields?"
 --> YES!

- for the Tracker model, what other relationship/s do I set upi between user and/or books, for example to make Tracker an attribute of user?

- what is this line for in config/urls.py?:
path("", include('library.urls')),
--> and why do we have two url files?

- VIEWS/URLs I need:
    --> Book list âœ….... w/ pk for user??
    --> ...


- users can search by Title; Author- anyone can add a new book that is NOT a duplicate (?)
- ONLY ADMIN can UPDATE (like whether it is featured) and DELETE
- Tracking status CAN be updated

--> ?? Do I want the whole app to have IsAuthenticated? permissions? Like add it to settings.py?
--> ?? Do I have to import: from rest_framework.permissions import IsAdminUser 
in view.py, or does importing permissions cover that?

--> Should my Book model have a user attribute?

Your app should allow users to:

list all books
list all featured books
create a book
retrieve details about a book
search books by author or title
see a list of all the books they are tracking and their statuses
mark a book as want to read, reading, or read
update the want to read/reading/read status of a book
see a list of all their books by status (e.g., all the books they have marked as "read")
retrieve all their own private notes for a book
retrieve all public notes for a book
create a note for a book
edit their own notes
Admin users can:

update a book (including marking/unmarking it as featured)
delete a book (this should not delete notes about a book)
