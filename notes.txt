- Will need:
 --> models (created Book; User, Author)
 --> views (class-based views)
 --> urls (in the path, view_name.as_view()?)
 --> serializers

- Views return JSON responses

- QUESTION, re: Serlializers:
 --> In the Book serializer, or any serializer, do I include all of the attributes in "fields?"
