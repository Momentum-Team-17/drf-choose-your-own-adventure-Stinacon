- Will need:
 --> models (created Book; User, Author)
 --> views (class-based views)
 --> urls (in the path, view_name.as_view()?)
 --> serializers

- Views return JSON responses

- QUESTION, re: Serlializers:
 --> In the Book serializer, or any serializer, do I include all of the attributes in "fields?"
 --> YES!

- for the Tracker model, what other relationship/s do I set upi between user and/or books, for example to make Tracker an attribute of user?

- what is this line for in config/urls.py?:
path("", include('library.urls')),
--> and why do we have two url files?

- VIEWS/URLs I need:
    --> Book list âœ….... w/ pk for user??
    -->
